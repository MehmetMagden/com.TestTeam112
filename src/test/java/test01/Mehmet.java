    when we clone the framework we should not touch anything

    first step is creating a branch for yourself
    git branch name   // name can be your name

    after everystep we should check where we are
    git branch

    to switch new branch
    git checkout name

    to control if we are in our branch
    git branch

    if everything is right you should be able to see a star at left side of your name
